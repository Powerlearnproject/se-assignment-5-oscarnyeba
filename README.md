Navigate to the VS Code Download Page:

Go to the official Visual Studio Code download page: Visual Studio Code.
Download the Installer:

On the download page, you will see different download options for various operating systems.
Click on the "Windows" button. This will download the installer for the latest stable version of VS Code (typically a file named VSCodeSetup-x64-<version>.exe).
Run the Installer:

Once the download is complete, open the downloaded file by double-clicking it.
If prompted by the User Account Control (UAC), click "Yes" to allow the installer to make changes to your device.
Follow the Installation Wizard:

The Visual Studio Code Setup Wizard will open. Click "Next" to proceed.
License Agreement: Read and accept the license agreement by clicking on the checkbox, then click "Next".
Destination Folder: Choose the destination folder where you want to install VS Code. The default path is usually fine (C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code). Click "Next".
Select Additional Tasks:
Choose additional tasks you want the installer to perform. It is recommended to select:
"Create a desktop icon"
"Add to PATH" (useful for accessing VS Code from the command line)
"Register code as an editor for supported file types"
"Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer file context menu"
"Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer directory context menu"
Click "Next".
Install:

Click the "Install" button to start the installation process.
The installer will copy files and set up VS Code on your system.
Finish:

Once the installation is complete, you will see a completion screen.
If you want to launch VS Code immediately, ensure the checkbox "Launch Visual Studio Code" is checked.
Click "Finish".
Post-Installation Steps
Launch VS Code:

If you didn't check the "Launch Visual Studio Code" checkbox, you can start VS Code from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging
1. Install Necessary Extensions
Depending on the programming language you're using, you might need to install specific extensions. For example:

For JavaScript/TypeScript: Ensure you have the built-in JavaScript/TypeScript extension enabled.
For Python: Install the Python extension by Microsoft.
For C++: Install the C/C++ extension by Microsoft.
You can install extensions by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), searching for the desired extension, and clicking Install.

2. Open or Create a Project
Open your project folder in VS Code by selecting File > Open Folder and navigating to your project directory.
If you don't have a project yet, you can create a new file by selecting File > New File, writing your code, and saving it in a new folder.
3. Configure the Debugger
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Debug: Open launch.json to create a launch.json file if it doesn't already exist.

Select the environment/language you are using. This will generate a basic configuration for your debugger. For example, here’s a sample launch.json configuration for a Node.js application:

json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
    }
  ]
}
Adjust the program path to point to your main application file.

4. Set Breakpoints
Open the file you want to debug.
Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear to indicate the breakpoint.
5. Start Debugging
Open the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.
Click the green play button (Start Debugging) or press F5 to start the debugging session.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints to pause the execution of your program at specific lines of code. This allows you to inspect variables and program flow.
Conditional breakpoints can be set by right-clicking on a breakpoint and specifying a condition.
Watch Variables:

In the Debug view, you can add expressions to the Watch section to monitor their values as you step through the code.
Call Stack:

The Call Stack panel shows the function call hierarchy leading to the current point of execution. This helps you understand the flow of execution and identify where errors may be occurring.
Variables Pane:

The Variables pane displays the current values of all variables in the current scope. It updates as you step through your code.
Step Controls:

Step Over (F10): Executes the next line of code, but does not step into functions.
Step Into (F11): Steps into the next function call.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Steps out of the current function.
Continue (F5): Resumes execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.
Debug Console:

The Debug Console allows you to execute arbitrary expressions and commands in the context of the currently paused execution.
Inline Values:

As you debug, VS Code can show the values of variables inline within the code editor, making it easier to see changes in state at a glance.
Exception Handling:

You can configure VS Code to break execution when exceptions are thrown, even if they are caught, by configuring the Caught Exceptions and Uncaught Exceptions settings in the Breakpoints pane.
Example: Debugging a Simple Node.js Program
Install Node.js Extension:

Ensure the JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly extension is installed.
Create a Simple Program:

Create a file named app.js with the following content:
javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const name = "World";
const message = greet(name);
console.log(message);
Set Up launch.json:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type Debug: Open launch.json, and select Node.js when prompted.
Adjust the launch.json as shown in the configuration example above.
Set a Breakpoint:

Open app.js and click in the gutter next to const message = greet(name); to set a breakpoint.
Start Debugging:

Open the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D) and click the Start Debugging button or press F5.
Inspect Variables:

When execution pauses at the breakpoint, use the Variables pane, Watch, and Debug Console to inspect and evaluate variables and expressions.
